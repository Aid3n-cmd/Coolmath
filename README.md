# Coolmath
CRASHING: The game is having some weird issues involving falling below the floor. Most of the main issues are coming from users on chromebooks, other issues outide of chromebooks is just the that browsers will start to lag after falling below the floor. Im looking into why this is happening. (The site will be down until i fix this)

Just to clarify
This is not coolmath, this is a flappy bird game for now
